# Zodkit

Zodkit is a collection of [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) utilities for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) actions, load functions, hooks and endpoints. It abstracts the complexity of parsing and validating `FormData`, `URLSearchParams` and `RouteParams` so they stay clean and are strongly typed. It is heavily based on [Zodix](https://github.com/rileytomasek/zodix/) by [Riley Tomasek](https://github.com/rileytomasek)
